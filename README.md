Plan is to create a conference call system to be used from the callbox it will:
- initiate a conference call from a phone number https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/conference
- make outgoing calls to multiple parties (probably Hill and I) https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/make-calls?code-sample=code-make-a-call-and-monitor-progress-events&code-language=Python&code-sdk-version=6.x
- if we answer and press any key, we will be connected to the conference line https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/gather
- eventually, I'll call the twimlet as well to allow for a flashing button on the wall
